# Hi, I’m Kimberly 👋  
**Data Analyst & Recent BSCS Graduate | Python, SQL, Data Visualization | Passionate about solving real-world problems through data**

I’m a recent graduate of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Western Governors University. My background blends technical rigor with self-directed problem solving, and I thrive on translating raw data into actionable insights.

I’ve independently designed and implemented projects involving **data analysis, database engineering, and machine learning workflows**, using real-world datasets to explore climate trends, delivery logistics, and reporting automation.

## 📌 Featured Projects
### 📍 [Climate Match System]<link coming soon>
A K-Means–based climate clustering tool that groups U.S. ZIP codes by 10-year average monthly temperatures to support relocation decisions. Designed and implemented full data pipeline—from raw ingestion to cluster visualization—using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn.

### 📍 [Dynamic Summary Reporting Tool]<link coming soon>
Built a dynamic SQL-based reporting system for a veterinary database. Used PostgreSQL to construct normalized tables, implement transformation logic, and automate summary table refresh using stored procedures and triggers.

### 📍 [Route Optimization System for Delivery Logistics]<link coming soon>
Created an efficient delivery route planner by implementing a custom hash table and nearest-neighbor algorithm to solve a real-world traveling salesman–style problem. Focused on algorithm design and object-oriented programming in Python.
