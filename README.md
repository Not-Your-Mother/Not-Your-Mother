# Hi, I’m Kimberly 👋  
**Data Analyst & Recent BSCS Graduate | Python, SQL, Data Visualization | Passionate about solving real-world problems through data**

I’m a recent graduate of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Western Governors University. My background blends technical rigor with self-directed problem solving, and I thrive on translating raw data into actionable insights.

I’ve independently designed and implemented projects involving **data analysis, database engineering, and machine learning workflows**, using real-world datasets to explore climate trends, delivery logistics, and reporting automation.

## 📌 Featured Projects
### 📍 [Climate Match System](https://github.com/Not-Your-Mother/Climate-Match-System.git)
A K-Means–based climate clustering tool that groups U.S. ZIP codes by 10-year average monthly temperatures to support relocation decisions. Designed and implemented full data pipeline—from raw ingestion to cluster visualization—using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn.

### 📍 [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Not-Your-Mother/Movie-Recommendation-System.git)
Built a recommendation engine using PostgreSQL and the DVD Rental sample database. Analyzed rental history to suggest new movies by genre, implemented using stored procedures, triggers, and transformation logic. Demonstrates how to extend a transactional schema with real-time personalization.

### 📍 [Route Optimization System for Delivery Logistics](https://github.com/Not-Your-Mother/Route-Optimization-System.git)
Created an efficient delivery route planner by implementing a custom hash table and nearest-neighbor algorithm to solve a real-world traveling salesman–style problem. Focused on algorithm design and object-oriented programming in Python.
